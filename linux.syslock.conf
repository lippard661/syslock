# Sample syslock.conf
# The immutable-flag config line is optional. Default behavior is
# schg for BSD, uchg for macOS (schg is equivalent on Apple Silicon,
# where there is no single-user mode) and +i (only supported option)
# for Linux.
# immutable-flag: [schg|uchg|+i]
# schg is system immutability flag and requires securelevel=0 (single
# user mode) to unlock.
#
# If immutable-flag: schg is used, a group name "uchg" can be used for
# files that are locked and unlocked with the uchg flag at any time
# with syslock -g uchg/sysunlock -g uchg.
# If the "uchg" group is added alongside other groups, you can lock and
# unlock only the files in the intersection of "uchg" and another group
# using syslock -g group:uchg/sysunlock -g group:uchg.
#
# If immutable-flag: uchg is used, a group name "schg" can be used for
# files that are locked and unlocked with the schg flag--unlocked only
# in single-user mode--with syslock -g schg/sysunlock -g schg.
# sysunlock with no args in such a case will skip over anything in the
# schg group if not in single-user mode.
#
# Flags in front of a file path:
# + Do not recurse through subdirectories.
# - Do not lock a directory itself, just its contents.
# ! If the -s option to syslock/sysunlock is used, only lock/unlock these items.
#    This allows syslock -s to be put in rc.securelevel, and sysunlock -s to be performed after shutdown.
# ! is in front of /usr/lib to permit libc.so reordering (OpenBSD 6.0+).
#
# Optionally groups of pathnames can be identified with a
# group: <groups>
# line in front of them. Group names can be alphanumeric plus hyphens,
# separated by spaces.
