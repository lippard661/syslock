Need a shell script (/bin/sh) which goes into /etc/rc.d and
will run sysunlock with specific groups if PGP-signed
appropriately. (unattached signatures?)  (Note: PGP::Sign
doesn't validate the specific key ID...)

Would also be nice to find a place to run sysunlock prior to library
reordering (even early daemons are too late); can't really do without
mods to /etc/rc. (Workaround is to use sysunlock -s while in single user
mode, i.e., after a shutdown, and then put syslock -s into rc.securelevel
after a long enough sleep for library and kernel reordering to occur.)

Don't try to remount / unless necessary.

Add -v verbose option.
