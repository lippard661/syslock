Need a shell script (/bin/sh) which goes into /etc/rc.d and
will run sysunlock with specific groups if PGP-signed
appropriately. (unattached signatures?)  (Note: PGP::Sign
doesn't validate the specific key ID...)

Would also be nice to find a place to run sysunlock prior to library
reordering (even early daemons are too late); can't really do without
mods to /etc/rc.

Don't try to remount / unless necessary.

Add -v verbose option.

Parse config more carefully to avoid command line injection--make sure
paths are really paths, and that they really exist before executing the
command lines. (Mostly OK as is for directories, but not at all for files.)
